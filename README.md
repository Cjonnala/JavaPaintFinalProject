SE 450 JPaint Project

I have implemented application as part of my course SE 450 Object Oriented Software Development.

Sprint 1:
For Sprint 1 I have implemented default rectangle shape with Red color, with Undo and Redo functions.

Points to be noted:
•	If any shape selected by default Rectangle shape only comes with Red colour.
•	If any shading type selected by default filled in rectangle will come.
•	Above 2 observations will be resolved in the next sprint.

Sprint 2: 

For this sprint I have implemented various colors, shading types and all three shapes (Rectangle,Ellipse,Triangle). I have also implemented Select and move operations.

Points to be noted:
•	If we do undo multiple time the shape is going out of the paint canvas, this bug will be fixed in coming sprints.

Sprint 3:

For this sprint I have implemented dashed outline for the shapes when they are selected. I have also implemented Copy, Paste and Delete Commands.

Points to be noted:
•	Multiple paste is not working when any shape is selected, this will be resolved in the next sprint.
