SE 450 JPaint Project

I have implemented application as part of my course SE 450 Object Oriented Software Development.

Sprint 1:
For Sprint 1 I have implemented default rectangle shape with Red color, with Undo and Redo functions.

Points to be noted:
•	If any shape selected by default Rectangle shape only comes with Red colour.
•	If any shading type selected by default filled in rectangle will come.
•	Above 2 observations will be resolved in the next sprint.
